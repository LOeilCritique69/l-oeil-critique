<p>After much discourse about Marvel Studios not moving fast enough, <em>Ironheart</em> is finally here. The Disney+ original series serves as both the final entry in <strong><a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Phase_Five" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phase Five</a></strong> of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Riri Williams’ first solo outing. From the outset, the characters are engaging and likable, and the show’s world is expansive and filled with energy. Most importantly, <em>Ironheart</em> seamlessly fits into the wider MCU franchise. Here, you can sense the influence of producer <strong>Ryan Coogler</strong> (<em><strong><a href="/2025/04/10/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-vampires/">Sinners</a></strong></em>), as <em>Ironheart</em> is a natural progression of Riri’s journey post-<em><strong><a href="/2022/11/08/black-panther-wakanda-forever-review-a-bold-exploration-on-grief-hope/">Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a></strong></em>. But don’t get it twisted, this is <strong>Chinaka Hodge</strong>’s show through and through. We know folks love to give men all the credit for a woman’s work.</p>
<p>Head writer Chinaka Hodge and Ryan Coogler evidently share similar interests and sensibilities. Through his production company, <strong><a href="https://www.proximitymedia.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proximity Media</a></strong>, Coogler has clearly created a safe space for Hodge to explore her personal experiences and exercise her passion through the character of Riri Williams. <em>Ironheart</em> tackles themes and topics that are not too dissimilar from what Coogler has conveyed in his own works. However, here we have a young Black woman at the center; she is brilliant and ambitious, but lacks the kind of cash flow her aspirational icon, <strong>Tony Stark</strong>, had. To stay ahead on her projects, Riri gets involved in some shady business that will force our science-minded genius to confront magic.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Marvel Show That Has It All</strong></h2>
<p style="content-visibility: auto;contain-intrinsic-size: auto 275.34375px;"><em>Ironheart</em> paves the way for Riri Williams to soar high in the MCU, whether she largely remains on television or transitions back onto the big screen. Either way, the creative team at hand does not disappoint with her first standalone outing. While MCU movies have grown stale and repetitive, with their cinematic ambitions often exceeding the capabilities of Marvel’s production quality, the TV shows have been making a slow comeback from a previous low point (looking at you, <em><strong><a href="https://screenrant.com/secret-invasion-1-year-on-retrospective/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Secret Invasion</a></strong></em>). MCU shows, such as <em><strong><a href="/2024/09/18/agatha-all-along-review-kathryn-hahn/">Agatha All Along</a></strong></em> and <em><strong><a href="/2025/03/04/daredevil-born-again-review-disney/">Daredevil: Born Again</a></strong></em>, are proving to be a safe haven for fans who want a stronger commitment to creating real, substantive connections to their favorite comic book characters.</p>

<p>Marvel characters have been flourishing in the series format in recent years. We aren’t burdened with meek attempts at snappy one-liners and meaningless easter eggs for the next big thing as a substitute for the story. <em>Ironheart</em> is further proof that embracing the present adventures and dangers our heroes face without wasting time on cheap franchise building accomplishes more in the long run. Sure, <em>Ironheart</em> features some of the typical MCU worldbuilding tactics, but that’s not the foundation of the show. <em>Ironheart</em> fully trusts that Riri can hold her own. No matter how much online trolls want to push the narrative that this series is a “flop” or unworthy of one’s time, those who watch it will be rewarded.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dominique Thorne Elevates Riri Williams to Icon Status</h2>
<p>Going into <em>Ironheart</em>, there is a feeling that Riri Williams has been robbed of the novelty of being the MCU’s young genius obsessed with Tony Stark. With an entire trilogy solidifying Tom Holland’s Peter Parker as Iron Man’s protégé, Riri is stepping into an unfair battle for favorites, though the two would probably be allies. However, those concerns are quickly washed away by how sincere and well-drawn Riri is. She is her own person, with a unique goal in mind. Dominique Thorne’s performance further cements that. Few castings in the MCU could be argued as “perfect,” and Thorne as Riri Williams is among them.</p>

<p>Dominique Thorne is a pure delight, portraying the impassioned and fiery spirit of Riri as if it were second nature. She also has the uncanny ability to click with everyone on screen. It helps that Riri is written so well, but Thorne’s gift of natural chemistry is priceless, even when talking to an A.I. construct in a metal suit. In particular, Thorne’s screentime with <strong>Lyric Ross</strong> (<em><strong><a href="/2022/10/28/henry-selick-on-wendell-wild-a-better-future-for-animation-exclusive-interview/">Wendell &amp; Wild</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/01/the-18-best-episodes-of-this-is-us.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This Is Us</a></strong></em>), who plays a huge role as Riri’s best friend, Natalie Washington, is vital to the foundation of the show. It’s through their friendship that we see the kind of loving and determined person Riri is.</p>
<p>That being said, Thorne knows how to match her co-star’s energies and level up at any moment, whether it be by delivering a joke with the right cadence or establishing her fearlessness with just her eyes.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>Ironheart</em> is Far Better than Most MCU Shows, Yet Still Flawed</strong></h2>
<p><em>Ironheart</em>, unfortunately, has two major flaws: our central antagonist is not a slam-dunk casting choice, and the show could have easily gone an episode or two longer. On the first point, Anthony Ramos (<em><strong><a href="/2024/07/17/twisters-review-lee-isaac-chung-crafts-a-riveting-sequel-with-genuine-heart/">Twisters</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a36664206/in-the-heights-movie-musical-differences/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">In the Heights</a></strong></em>) is underwhelming as Parker Robbins/The Hood. Lacking in energy and underplaying everything in an effort to come across as “cool” or understated, Ramos doesn’t quite fit with what everyone else is going for. It’s just hard to see him as a standout when Thorne, Ross, and the eclectic ensemble have their characters’ personalities dialed up to an 11. Even those who have a lot less screen time, like Regan Aliyah’s Zelma Stanton, leave a bigger impression than the main villain.</p>
<p>As for the series length, it would have been nice to have a few more episodes to explore the rest of the jam-packed cast. The six-episode “miniseries” length is especially flawed when considering how The Hood’s crew is made up of notable Marvel villains such as Sonia Denis’s pyrotechnics specialist <strong>Clown</strong>; Shakira Barrera and Zoe Terakes’ <strong>Blood Brothers</strong>, Shea Couleé’s former drag queen turned hacker <strong>Slug</strong>, and Eric André’s tech-savvy <strong>Rampage</strong>. They are a fun crew, but merely exist to create background noise for The Hood and Riri’s relationship. These villains become inconsequential rather quickly, and extra minutes to spare on them would have done a lot to make them worthy of their infamous monikers.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Riri’s Personal Relationships are Vital, But Aren’t Given Much Room For Growth</strong></h2>
<p>Extra episodes could have also spent additional time establishing Riri’s relationship with her newly acquired villains and allies. The dynamics between Parker Robbins a.k.a. The Hood and another surprise villain are somewhat undercut by the limited episode run. Riri simply isn’t given enough time to connect with The Hood to make their “friends to enemies” arc feel as monumental as it turns out to be. On the flipside, as Riri’s scientific mind is challenged with the Hood’s dark magic, she creates other unexpected yet helpful bonds that aren’t given a lot of room to grow either.</p>

<p>The production and costume design of <em>Ironheart</em> are superb. Subtle visual cues seamlessly blend together science and magic, the two crucial elements of the narrative. Great lengths are taken to create a rich environment that resonates with Riri as a character and her overall journey. An extra episode or two could have given viewers more precious time in these spaces. Without getting into spoilers, fleshing out the exposition and further establishing fairly notable Marvel characters would have done wonders for the show’s worldbuilding. What we do get is barely enough, though. Hopefully, audiences get to see the promises of this first and apparently <em>only</em> season (as it’s being marketed as a miniseries) pay off in the MCU’s near future.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Marvel Would be Foolish Not to Invest More Time Into Riri Williams</strong></h2>
<p>For someone who has become rather adverse to the MCU these days, the shows have been a nice means of getting reacquainted with the franchise without feeling overwhelmed by constant easter eggs and tests of one’s Marvel knowledge. When compared to the bloated blockbuster films that seem to compete for the most characters on screen, the Disney+ shows offer a much-welcome detour that allows these interesting comic heroes to thrive. <em>Ironheart</em> benefits from having a pre-established fan-favorite as the lead, with all of her finest qualities leaping from the comic pages to the small screen.</p>
<p>There is little that needs to be done to endear us to Riri Williams because Dominique Thorne is so effortlessly engaging in the role. An authentic portrayal of Black girl magic enriches Chinaka Hodge’s writing. The plot progresses at a breezy pace, the humor lands, and the emotional narrative at the core doesn’t miss a beat. <em>Ironheart</em> is a sweet and endearing tale about a bright young woman finding herself and rediscovering her place in a rapidly changing world. Culture, family, and community play a significant part in this intimate journey of unearthing one’s inner strength. Marvel Studios has a new star on their hands, and fans can only hope that the franchise will aspire to do her justice.</p>
